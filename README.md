# Telecom Carrier, the challenge Solution.

Read more about the challenge here: [Telecom Carrier, the frontend project.](https://github.com/EvoluxBR/front-end-test)

Notes:
- Redux was used for example purposes, to store the search value while navigating between pages;
- To simulate part of the backend behavior, changes to the example data are saved in cookies to appear as though they were actually modified;
- I used Tailwind for styling;
- I used SWR for data fetching.
